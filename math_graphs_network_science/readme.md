A Practical Introduction to Mathematical Graphs and Network Science
===========

**[Topcoder][3]**. Data structures to use with graph problems. 

**[History of graph theory][4]**. The origins of graph theory going back to 178 when Leonhard Euler described a solution ot the Koningsber bridges problem.

**[Mark Newman][1]**. The scientific study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has received an enormous amount of interest in the last few years. 

**[Laszlo Barabasi][2]**. Networks are everywhere, from the internet, to social networks, and the genetic networks that determine our biological existence.

**[Exploring the fringes of Complexity][4]**. A "survey [of] the literature on 
human-centred experiments to understand how, in practice, different features and characteristics 
of node-link diagrams affect visual complexity"

**[Graph Neural Networks][5]**. A comprehensive survey on graph neural nets.
